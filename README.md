# Social Sharing MODX
Add social sharing links and buttons without the bloat for MODX Revolution (based on [Social Sharing](https://github.com/cferdinandi/social-sharing)).

The widgets provided by Twitter, Facebook, and other services require numerous HTTP requests and can really hurt the performance of your sites and apps. These simple CSS and HTML snippets make it easy for you to go social - without hurting site performance.

## How It Works
Getting started with Social Sharing is really easy. For details, see the `index.html` file.

## Changelog
* Version 1.0 (november 6, 2013)
  * Initial release.
